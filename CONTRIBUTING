# Using Github issues

Github issues should be limited to report bugs, and for additional feature
requests. 

Please, do not post random questions that are not critical. The core staff is happy to help you
and provide timely support in our chat rooms.

# Providing a new feature or bugfix.

If you wish to contribute a new feature, we recommend you to contact the staff through
the chatrooms. Be sure to explain what you would like to accomplish and its purpose.
We will determine whether your feature should be implemented.

Also, keep in mind that our staff is always busy. This does not mean that we are not interested
in your feature, however, we must give priority to critical bugs.

Thank you very much.
